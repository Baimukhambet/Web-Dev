        <p>To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
            Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
            The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
            Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
            And by opposing end them. To dieâ€”to sleep,<br>
            No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
            The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
            That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation<br>
            Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</p>
